<h2>About me 👨‍💻</h2>
<b>An android developer with <b>1+</b> years experience<br></b>
Currently, I'm working on android framework and trying to learn more concepts. But every time I'm thinking about flutter.<br>
It's good to say that 3 month ago I decided to make a team and work with them on open source projects and develop applications.<br>
Now!, <b>Vistaroid</b> has been borned and I'm so happy that we can help each other and early other developers.<br>
As I sayd, I would like to be a part of a team rather than working on projects alone.<br>
<h2>Vistaroid 📱</h2>
A virtual team made with 4 developers about 3 month ago<br>
our goal is help each other in projects and improve knowledges with play weekly meetings and talk about works and android convepts.
