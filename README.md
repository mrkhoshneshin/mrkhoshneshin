### Hi I'm MohammadJavad 😃  <br><br>
<h2>About me 👨‍💻</h2>
<b>An android developer with <b>1+</b> years experience<br></b>
Currently, I'm working on android framework and trying to learn more concepts. But every time I'm thinking about flutter.<br>
As I said, I would like to be a part of a team rather than working on projects alone.<br>
